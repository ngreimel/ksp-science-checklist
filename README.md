# KSP Science Checklist

This project analyzes a Kerbal Space Program save file and outputs a list of science completed and to-do. Future iterations will allow a user to keep track of in-progress science (so they can make sure they've collected all they can before returning to KSC).


## Usage

The analyzer can be run from any modern browser using JavaScript. It requires the user to import a `.sfs` file. [How do I find my save file?](https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Root_directory#Saves)
